This was a super short productivity project. I created it to learn about creating Slackbots, and to help my team utilize ChatGPT straight from Slack!

It's also [open source](https://github.com/c00/chad-gupity)!

I'll get to writing this article at some point, but until then, enjoy the [source code](https://github.com/c00/chad-gupity) instead.
