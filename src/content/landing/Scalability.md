## Scalable Systems

If they can't climb over a wall, I don't want anything to do with them. No, wait, the other kind of scalable.

Systems that work regardless of whether you have *10 users* or *10 million* users. That's the philosophy. Everything we make
comes in a format that it can be run on any environment, be it `AWS`, `Digital Ocean`, `Supabase`, or any other third party or self-hosted system. 

Where possible we deploy front-end applications to the edge: No matter where your customers are, they will have a blazingly fast exprience.
Nowadays there's no excuse for a slow server (other than GDPR compliance).
