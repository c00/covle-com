## Professional Full Stack And Devops

We have experience with many *front-end frameworks and toollings* such as `Svelte(kit)`, `Angular`, `Tailwind`, `Vite`, `Bootstrap`, etc. What about deployment? We can deploy to modern platforms such as `Firebase`, `Supabase`, `Vercel`, `Cloudflare Pages`, `Deno Deploy` and others.

Are you in the market for self-hosted solution? Good choice! Most of our privacy-aware clients want exactly that! We can setup and maintain self-healing `kubernetes clusters` at any provider that offers these clusters, even if that provider is your own IT-department! And if that's still not enough, we deliver everything in docker containers to be as infrastructure-agnostic as possible.

Need a REST API? Yeah you do! We've built APIs with `Typescript`, `Go` and `Python`.
