## Security and Privay come First!

We are strong advocates for privacy and security. Your data is yours. You users' data is theirs. Due to a long history of having the German Government as a client, we have tremendous knowledge and experience with creating GDPR compliant solutions that take security serious. 

> It's not just a checklist, it's a mindset. 

Nowadays we see product after product getting hacked, having data leaked or stolen, or just plainly lying about their privacy and security posture. We are willing to put our money where are mouth is. We've survived independent audits of our code base before, and we'll happily do it again! 

We can host everything on-prem or at your MSP. Not a single request will touch a CDN if that's what you require. Not a single Javascript file will be shipped to your users if that is the level of care you wish to take. Authentication and authorization can be done with self-hosted, battle tested open-source solutions (e.g. keycloak) or by integrating into your existing oAuth or SAML schemes.
